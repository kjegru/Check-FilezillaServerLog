# FileZilla-Server-LogFile-Check-for-Uploads
  Goes through the FileZilla server log file to check if file is uploaded and messages a person for each file that is uploaded.
  Future plans:
  - ignore list (for those sites with automatic uploads)
  - convert IPs to names to better see who is connecting to each customer
