# FileZilla-Server-LogFile-Check-for-Uploads
  Goes through the FileZilla server log file to check if file is uploaded and messages/writes to console for each file that is uploaded.
  Future plans:
  - ignore list (for those sites with automatic uploads)
  - convert IPs to names to better see who is connecting to each customer
  - the array works different with different powershell versions. Check PSversion and handle log string accordingly.
